# Java-StoryWeb
Java programming - User interactive story tree

I created a program in Java called StoryWeb.

It is interactive with the user.

StoryWeb prints out portions of stories of various genres with breaks in scenarios.

Each story has a beginning, middle, and end.

It first asks the user to choose a genre.

It prints out the beginning of a story then gives the user two options.

It requests the user to make a choice of action about the scenario.

Based on the answer a different permutation of the scenario will carry out.

I thought it would be neat to bridge a gap between Human and Machine - to communicate, participate, and create together.
